# Version 1.5 GUI

**1: A "GUI" system was implemented for greater convenience and a better style.**

**2: The method for downloading songs via playlists is still under development. Who knows when it will be finished, xd.**

**3: The album system might have data handling issues, but that depends on the "API". (I reverse-engineered it to download the data, xd.)**

# 📢 DISCLAIMER

**• This tool was created for learning purposes and I am not responsible for the misuse of this tool as it is not downloaded directly from the "spotify" page, it is an external page of spotify. The use of the name of this tool "downloader-music-spotify" is offered only as a context.**
# 
**• This tool was created to avoid the 3-day download limit and out of boredom, xd.**
